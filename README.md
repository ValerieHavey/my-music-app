# Welcome to My Music App!

## An App for Collecting Your Music

## Objective of the App

    *   Sign in securely and view your music collection.
    *   Create, Read, Update, and Delete music entries in your collection.

<!-- ReadMe Template Worksheet

Your ReadMes are the key deliverable that engineers will want to see as part of your job search. Each engineering team will look at different aspects of your ReadMe and repo. Some will go into the code itself and explore. Others will just want to see the showcase code snippets in the main ReadMe. Some will read the full thing to understand your approach, others will skim to specific sections.

It’s crucial that you cover all the different sections below to ensure that you’ve got the information for all engineers that check these out.

We regularly have employers discuss the importance of the ReadMes in what they’re looking for and why they interview the grads that they do - so don’t underestimate the importance of writing strong ReadMes!

For any pair or group project, you cannot share a ReadMe. These must be written independently to ensure that the engineers reading this understands your specific experience and approach.

It’s a good idea to start your ReadMes during the planning stage as this is the best way to get ahead and save time when it comes to finalising your first draft post-project. As you plan each aspect of your project, note down what you intend to do with screenshots of your plan and anything else you think would be useful, then when you execute this part in your code, you can adjust this part of your ReadMe as needed depending on how your process changed, or if it went as planned then you can leave it as it is.

Make a copy of this document for each project you use throughout the course and fill in each section.

Once the content has been finalised here, you can then quickly upload these onto your GitHub repository later.




Things To Consider:

That there are no spelling mistakes in your ReadMe - if you see a spelling error highlighted below, edit this.
Some engineers will reject applicants if their ReadMes are full of mistakes. From their perspective, if your ReadMes are full of mistakes, what is your code like…

That your technologies are capitalised correctly - i.e JavaScript, jQuery, MongoDB

That your formatting is consistent throughout - headers, indentation, full stops in bullets etc

Any hyperlink included works

That you include images throughout - code snippets, pictures of your planning stage, screenshots of the final project.
These can be still screenshots or gifs
This breaks up the text in your ReadMe and helps to keep the reader engaged

That your ReadMe sounds like you - see this as an opportunity to showcase who you are to the engineering community and prospective employers.
Think back to the Personal Brand session and how employers want to get a sense of who you are. The content you write should sound as if you’re talking through your experience.  -->

### MVP:

- The app utilizes EJS Templates for rendering views to users.
- The app uses session-based authentication.
- The app’s files are organized following the conventions taught in lectures.
- The app has at least one data entity in addition to the User model. At least one entity must have a relationship with the User model.
- The app has full CRUD functionality.
- Authorization is implemented in the app. Guest users (those not signed in) should not be able to create, update, or delete data in the application or access functionality allowing those actions.
- The app is deployed online so that the rest of the world can use it.

### Code Convention:

- The game can be played without encountering errors. No errors may be present in the console in the browser.
- The code in the app adheres to coding conventions covered in lessons, like using plural names for arrays.
- There is no remaining dead and/or commented out code or console logs outside of a commented out Code Graveyard section of your code.
- The game may not utilize the prompt() or alert() methods.
- The game is coded using proper indentation.

### UI/UX:

- Your app exhibits a visual theme, like a consistent color palette and cohesive layout across pages.
- CSS Flexbox or Grid is utilized for page layout design.
- The site is easily navigable by a first-time user. For example, navigation should be done through links instead of having to type in a URL to navigate around the app.
- Colors used on the site have appropriate contrast, meeting WCAG 2.0 level AA standards.
- When editing an item, the form is pre-filled with that item’s details.
- Only the user who created data can see and interact with the UI for editing or deleting that data.
- All images on the site have alt text.
- No text is placed on top of an image in a way that makes the text inaccessible.
- All buttons are styled.

<!-- Planning

Instructions

The planning stage is important, as all projects in your future roles will have detailed plans before any coding happens. It is a great experience to share with potential engineer employers, as this reflects real engineering team practices.

Start by explaining the initial steps you took in the project.

Did you do any sketches? If so, discuss this and include images.
Any wireframes of the front end and UI? You did? Then explain this and include images.
Any ERDs? (Entity Relationship Diagram) Same here, explain and include images.
Use a project management tool to plan the sprint? If so, talk through this - what tool did you use? How you allocated tickets/responsibilities, sprint timeline etc. Also include screenshots of this.
Any pseudocode?
If it was a group or pair project - Discuss who was designated which tasks. This is very important, as engineers want to understand who owned the different code elements when looking at a group project.

For each project, review the above bullets and discuss every step you took in the planning stage, including the relevant images.

Not every project will include the above, but it’s important to discuss any of the bullets that you did implement.

Insert your Planning here: -->

### Planning:

    Trello used to complete a list of AAU, Wireframes, ERD, and Stretch Goals

   Edit the song as needed, then click the Edit Song button
   You are then taken back to your Index page
9. The Delete song button will immediately delete the song then return you back to the Index page.

<!-- Build/Code Process

Instructions

The Build/Code Process will be the longest section of your ReadMe and will be most insightful to the engineers that review them. This is where you will discuss the steps you took to code the project.

You want to see your ReadMes as a way to walk the engineers through your approach and problem solving from the start of the project through to the end.

You'll need to include a minimum of 3-4 code snippets, highlighting code you're particularly proud of and these code snippets will have descriptions on what you did, how and why to set the context of the snippet you include. These explanations are important for the engineers, as they will want to understand what you did and the reasoning behind the steps you took.

You don't need to document every single thing you coded, but walk them through the key sections of the project build.

For any group project, you will just focus on your contributions.

Some people will document the build/code process by discussing the key stages they worked on. Others will do a day by day guide. It’s entirely up to you how you structure this, as long as you discuss all the key things above.

Insert your Build/Code Process here: -->

<!-- Challenges

Instructions

Challenges are great for showing your learning journey and problem solving, and this is a section that many engineers will check out. Every day of your engineering career you’ll encounter challenges, this is part of your growth and development. It’s the challenges you encounter that helps you become a stronger and more competent engineer.

Here you will detail any particular challenges you encountered as you were coding the project.

Questions to answer here:

What technical challenges did you come across?
Why were these challenges?
What problem solving did you do to rectify them?
Team dynamics/ Project management
Tools/Tech you used

Insert your Challenges here: -->

### Challenges:

- Not working fast enough / having enough time to add more options, such as, adding a sort by function, search function, adding audio clips, viewing another users music collection, and being able to suggest music to another user.
- Going through the CSS after not really working on CSS in many weeks.

<!-- Wins

Instructions

The Wins section is your opportunity to highlight the aspects of your project you are most proud of. See this as your chance to showcase these parts of your projects to the engineers reading your ReadMes.

Things you could discuss here:

Interesting problem solving you did
Strong sections of code
Collaboration with other team members
Visual design of the project

Insert your Wins here: -->

### Wins:

- It's pretty and it works.

<!-- Key Learnings/Takeaways

Instructions

This section is one of the other most important parts of your ReadMe from an engineers’ perspective and helps to differentiate each of you from your classmates and team members.

Engineers love to understand what you learn from each project and how it has shaped you as an engineer.

See this as your opportunity to show the engineers how your skills grew during each project sprint.

Things you could discuss here:

What Technologies/Tools do you now feel more confident with? Tell them specifically what you learnt about these.
What engineering processes did you become more comfortable with? Standups? Pair programming? Project management? Tell them what you learnt from these processes?

Insert your Key Learnings/Takeaways here: -->

### Key Learnings/ Takeaways:

- Always test your code immediately after completing something.

<!-- Bugs

Instructions

If you have any bugs in your project, it’s important that you flag them in your ReadMe. This helps the engineers reviewing your projects to understand that you are aware that there are issues - if you don’t flag these, then they won’t have that visibility that you know these problems are in your code and it can result in them not having a full understanding of your technical knowledge.

In either sentences or bullets, explain what the bugs are.

If you have no bugs, you can leave this section blank.

Insert your Bugs here: -->

### Bugs:

<!-- Future Improvements

Instructions

It’s common to get to the end of your project and have ideas on what you would do if you have more time, as well as how you might improve it.

If you do, you should detail this here. It’s great to give that context on potential future improvements, to share your creative or technical ideas with the engineers reading your ReadMes.

In either sentences or bullets, explain what your future improvements would be.

Insert your Future Improvements here: -->

### Future Improvements:

- Adding a sort-by function,
- adding a search function,
- adding audio clips and ability to play a song,
- adding the ability to create playlists
- viewing another users music collection,
- and being able to suggest music to another user.
